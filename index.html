            <h2>Intro:</h2>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>I'm a computer engineer who's extremely passionate about technology and  working with technology. I love to program, write code, design circuits, prototype, and design websites. I am an Evans Scholar attending Marquette University. Aside from technology, I also have a career in real estate and I am in the process of acquiring my real estate brokerage license in Illinois. I enjoy working with people and helping them however I can with tutoring, coding/technology assistance, or assisting them with their real estate needs. I have been a real estate marketer for 3 years now and I have been a programmer since the 8th grade. I graduate with my Bachelors of Engineering in Spring 2022 for Computer Engineering and I am looking forward to my career as a Full Stack Developer and Real Estate Broker.</p>

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
          </header>
          <section>
            <p>I have always been intrigued by technology. Working with technology is something that comes naturally to me and that I enjoy very much. The design process from start to finish is something I am passionate for and I enjoy execeuting in every step. Of course, this include working with others to achieve a common goal. I would say my strength in working with others come from me being a Pentecostal Christian with strong faiths. Asides from web development/computer engineering, some of my other interests include astronomy and physics.</p>
